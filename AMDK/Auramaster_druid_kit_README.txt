Many players have found Cernd NPC too weak too be playable. This mod adds a new druid kit to the
game and then applies the new kit to Cernd. As a result, the player can choose to play with an
Auramaster PC or let Cernd join the party (or both). 

We should naturally expect druids (with their Connection with nature and all the energies
floating in it) to be more powerful than what we see in the game. Those who share this opinion
and sentiment with me will enjoy playing this kit.

==========================================
Important notes about Auramaster druid kit:
==========================================

I- This mod requires TOB.
II- You will need to start a new game after installing this mod (even if you already had an older
    version of the mod).

======================
Description of the kit:
======================

This sort of druids have a special ability to use the magical aura and energy spread and
floating in the nature and to weave and cast spells faster and more frequently than ordinary
spellcasters. They also can cast spells which are not available to other druids. At lower levels,
the additional spells will be just duplicates of a few clerical and wizard spells, but at higher
levels they can cast a number of entirely new spells as well.

Advantages:

1- +2 bonus to casting speed
2- Immunity to silence.
3- Can memorize one additional spell per spell level.
4- Access to additional spells as follows (the asterisked spells are new):

Additional first level spell spell: Burning hands
Additional second level spells: Invisibility, Mirror Image
Additional third level spells: Fire Arrow, Invisibility 10' radius
Additional fourth level spells: Emotion, Fire Shield (Red), Greater Malison
Additional fifth level spells: Protection From Acid
Additional sixth level spells: Chain Lightining, Death Spell, Unleash Energy*
Additional seventh level spells: Aura Cleansing*, Perfect Camouflage*, Power word Stun,
                                 Ruby Ray Of Reversal

5- At level 13, gains 40% resistance to magic damage.
6- At level 15, Gains the innate ability "Contact with Nature". This ability can be used once per
                day to regenerate 24 hp per round for 10 rounds.
7- At level 22, gains the innate ability, Aura of invulnerability, which grants immunity to 4th
(and lower) level spells and acts as a shield of energy, absorbing 40% of all physical damage as
well as granting +6 bonus to AC for 12 rounds. The ability can be used but once per day.


Disadvantages:

1- Cannot wear any armour
2- Cannot shape shift
3- Receives a -4 penalty to Strength
4- Receives a -4 penalty to constitution
5- Requires 12 Intelligence
6- Cannot dual class
7- Does NOT gain the ordinary druidic immunity to poison (at level 15) and partial resistance to
   elemental damage (at level 18)

*Descriptions of new spells:

Unleash Energy:

Level: 6
School: Evocation
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One target
Range: 100
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell unleashes an outstanding bolt of energy which inflicts 10d8 points of magic
damage to a single target.


Aura Cleansing:

It is the same as the mage HLA, Improved Alacrity.


Perfect Camouflage(Abjuration)
Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 20 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Casting this powerful spell makes the Auramaster druid invisible and immune to all divination
spells for the duration of the spell. If the druid attacks or casts offensive spells during this
period of time, he or she will become partially visible and will be subject to physical attack,
but no spell can be directly cast on him or her. Note that this spell doesn't make the caster
immune to those spells which affect an area instead of an individual target. Since Auramasters
cast spells more quickly than other spellcasters, the effective casting time of this spell is 3.
A successful remove magic can dispel the effects of this spell.
